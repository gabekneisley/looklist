Welcome to Looklist!
========
What is it?
---
Looklist is an app to help consumers express and communicate their personal style easily and connect with 
the fashion brands they love.

How does it work?
---
Christine Chen is 22 years old and loves fashion. She has a personal style that is hard to shop for. She's
a bit bohemian in the winter, and beachy with a little leather and goth in the warmer months. She is 
opinionated and either likes or hates most of what she sees. 

With Looklist, she can browse editorials, advertisements, blogs, stores--basically any digital fashion 
source--and quickly add the items she loves to one or more of her personal looks. She can also add the 
clothes she already owns. She can then share these looks with the whole world, some or all of her facebook 
friends, the brands who sell things she doesn't own, or with no one at all. She has control over 
who sees what on a look-by-look basis.

She has also given detailed measurements to looklist (which are only shown to merchants who are bound to a
strict privacy policy). This lets sellers know how to size her, even if she doesn't know how their sizes 
run.

When she checks into a participating store with looklist (which she has also marked to check her in on 
Foursquare), she is told which items are in stock in the store in her size.

How is it built?
---
Looklist will probably built with a Node/Express/Mongo(oose)/Jade/Bootstrap stack so that it is easy to
bring a team up to speed and build something awesome.

We'll host an api for fashion brands to add items (or notify us of data to ingest) and an api for brands
to communicate to consumers in realtime. We'll also build a consumer-facing website.
